      <h3>Uncovering the Truth </h3>
      <div id="LeftBG">
        <p><em>Persephone Demeter, 21, vanished without a trace. The authorities called it unremarkable. We call it a cover up. This site exists to document her disappearance, connect the dots others wont, and uncover the truth behind the secret organization known only as Hades. </em></p>
        <p>They told me it was just a missing persons case. But nothing about this is normal. <a href="."></a> </p>

      <h3>Entry: March 18 – The Night Everything Changed</h3>
      <p>March 18 began like any other day. Persephone had her environmental systems lecture in the afternoon and told me shed be staying late to finalize research at the university lab. She left home around 3:00 PM. That was the last time I saw her.
        At 8:32 PM, I sent her a message: “Let me know when youre heading back.” It was marked as delivered, but she never opened it. By 10:00 PM, her phone was off the grid. Calls went straight to voicemail. That wasnt like her not even close.</p>
      <p>Her usual route home leads past the east trail near the maintenance corridor behind campus. Quiet, isolated, and poorly lit. A location Ive since learned has no working CCTV security confirmed that camera feeds covering the area went offline between 9:40 and 10:05 PM. Persephone typically left the lab around 9:45.
        Thats the exact window she would have passed through. <a href="."></a></p>
      <p>I filed a missing persons report within the hour. No immediate action was taken. No alerts. No canvassing. Authorities cited “no signs of foul play.” But there are patterns glitches, missing time, corrupted data all too precise to be random.

        That wasnt just the night Persephone disappeared. It was the night something deeper began to surface. I believe she was taken. And I believe whoever did it knew exactly what they were doing.</p>

    <p>Earlier this week, an independent environmental survey team uncovered a sealed access hatch beneath an abandoned maintenance tunnel less than two miles from the location where Persephone Demeters phone last pinged. The hatch, previously unlisted on city infrastructure maps, was found after abnormal heat signatures were detected in the surrounding soil.</p>
    <p>Preliminary readings indicate signs of sustained underground activity, including elevated electromagnetic levels and displaced root systems both consistent with areas Persephone had been studying prior to her disappearance. Samples have been submitted for analysis, and investigators affiliated with The Hollow Signal are working to determine if the site may have served as a concealed entry point tied to the Hades organization.</p>
